# Class project
# Thera Bank Customer Conversion
# Converting current depositors to depositors/borrowers
# Business Understanding
# Context: who is Thera Bank? 
# Problem: too many deposit (liability) customers, not enough loaners (asset) customers
# Creative solution: target current customers as opposed to attracting new ones

# Determine which of Thera Bankâ€™s current deposit-only customers have a high likelihood of taking out a loan, and target them for marketing loan products.
