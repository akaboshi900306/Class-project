Thera Bank Customer Conversion
Converting current depositors to depositors/borrowers
# Business Understanding
<pre>Context: who is Thera Bank? 
Problem: too many deposit (liability) customers, not enough loaners (asset) customers
Creative solution: target current customers as opposed to attracting new ones

# Business Goal 
<pre>
Determine which of Thera Bank’s current deposit-only customers have a high likelihood of taking out a loan, and target them for marketing loan products. 

# Data Understanding
Here’s a screenshot of the first few rows of our dataset, which we got it from Kaggle. The dataset has 5000 instances and 14 columns. Each instance represents a current depositor in Thera Bank. And there are no missing values in this dataset. The blue box includes our 12 attributes, the red box includes our target variable which is whether customers accept personal loan offered in the last marketing campaign, with 0 meaning no, and 1 meaning yes. Since we have a specific target which is to identify who will become our borrowers, this is a classification problem.
